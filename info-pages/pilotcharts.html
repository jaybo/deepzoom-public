    <h2>How to read pilot charts</h2>

    <p>
        The Pilot Charts layer lets you plan a route based on historically measured wind speeds and directions. While
        traditional pilot charts were created using collated logs from thousands of actual ocean crossings, DeepZoom
        uses satellite derived averages of wind speeds and directions. The background shows mean historical wind speed
        along with arrows showing mean wind direction for each 14 day period.

        Superimposed on this background is a dynamic windrose which shows the percentage of time the wind is blowing from each
        of 16 cardinal/secondary/intercardinal directions. The length of each bar shows the percentage of time the wind
        blows from that direction averaged over a 14 day period. The length of the colored rectangles within each bar
        indicates the percentage of time the wind blows with each velocity range.

        Here's a trip showing how Columbus travelled to the Bahamas on his first voyage. The bar from due east ending in
        the number "42", indicates that the wind was blowing from that cardinal direction 42% of the time. The wind was
        under 20 knots about 40% of the time, and there was an easterly component virtually all the time. Columbus was
        sailing pretty much straight down wind.
